## MKW Scripting Modules

This directory contains a plethora of python scripts created to interface programatically with Mario Kart Wii. It was created by TASLabz with contributions from malleo, kiero04 and many others, and is based on the Dolphin Pycore fork which itself is based on Felk's scripting fork. These modules have been modified to work specifically with Felk's fork, bypassing the additions of Pycore to facilitate more recent updates which include screen grabbing capabilities.

The git repository for these modules can be found [here](https://github.com/TASLabz/mkw-scripts).

Usage examples can be found in the RMC folder in `_draw_info_display.py` and `_draw_input_display.py` along with additional TASing tools and ghost management programs.
